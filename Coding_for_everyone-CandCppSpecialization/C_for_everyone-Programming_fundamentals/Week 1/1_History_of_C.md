# Origins of the C Programming Language

## Inventor and Purpose

- **Inventor:** Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language in 1972.
- **Purpose:** Initially, C was designed to build an operating system, which became the renowned Unix operating system.

## Unix: A Game Changer

- Unix, born from Ritchie and Ken Thompson's research at Bell Labs, gained fame and remains in use today.
- Initially, Unix was freely distributed, making it accessible for small timesharing systems and multi-user setups on small computers.
- In the early days, as minicomputers emerged, Unix provided a cost-effective solution compared to massive systems from companies like IBM and Burroughs.

## Wider Impact

- Over time, Unix extended its reach, being used in personal computers.
- It serves as the foundation for Linux and is a crucial component of the Macintosh Operating System.
- Both Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson received the prestigious Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science, highlighting the significance of their work.
